#### The best way for learning Jsonnet in my opinion is trough hands on first place to start with is:
https://jsonnet.org/learning/tutorial.html

#### For the next step [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is required followed up by the prerequisites mentioned in [Installation](/intro/install).

### Rendering the Configuration to YAML or JSON from VScode
To render in YAML or JSON in VScode use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and search for:
-  `jsonnet: Evaluate file(YAML)` for yaml evaluation
-  `jsonnet: Evaluate file(YAML)` for json evaluation
:::note
#### Make sure you have the Jsonnet Language Server Plugin. 
Also you should setup your lib paths because jsonnet does not find them automatically

This topic is covered in [Installtion](/intro/install).

Now that we are all set we should get our hands dirty.
